12.18:
A. H2, L2, U2, H1, L1, S2, U1, S1, T1, T2
Unsafe because the L1 puts it into the Unsafe region since S2 has not been called yet. 

B. H2, H1, L1, U1, S1, L2, T1, U2, S2, T2
Safe because this trajectory does not pass through the Unsafe region.

C. H1, L1, H2, L2, U2, S2, U1, S1, T1, T2
Unsafe because this trajectory passes through the Unsafe region when L2 is called before U1 and S1 are. 

12.24:
The functions are implicitly reentrant. They are not explicitly reentrant because pointers may be passed in. However, they are thread-safe.
The caller must not pass in any pointers to shared data to be considered implicitly reentrant. Since the functions in the book are called with pointers to nonshared data, 
the functions in the RIO I/O package are implicitly reentrant.
